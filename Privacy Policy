Camelot Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store and protect your account information throughout our services.

The Information we collect
1) User ID's: To distinguish accounts from one another we're required to use user ID's as that's the only identifying variable on discord when creating an account.
2) Channel ID's: When an admin on a server chooses to disable a channel on their server using our command, the channel ID gets stored so the bot won't respond on messages coming from there anymore.
3) Account details: Any progress made on a user account will be stored as required and bound to the user account.

The information provided above is up to date and will be changed accordingly if any changes should occure. Users will be properly notified in case of changes.

We do not store any more information about users than we need to for our services to work properly, and every user is welcome to request a complete removal of his/her accumulated data on our support server (https://discord.gg/myy9PBCdEW).
None of our collected data, be it about user accounts or statistics, is being shared with anyone outisde our staff. The bot owner is the only person with direct access to our database.
